# font-awesome-svg
In the last couple years, I've worked with many designers who like to use icons from Font Awesome. Since I'm generally only using a handful on each project, I prefer to put them into code as an SVG rather than loading the entire Font Awesome library.

This repo contains all of Font Awesome's icons exported as individual SVG icons to make development easier.


## License and Credits

- Font Awesome is licensed under the SIL OFL 1.1.
- This repo is licensed under the MIT license.
- Many of these SVG icons came from another repo, [Font-Awesome-SVG-PNG](https://github.com/encharm/Font-Awesome-SVG-PNG/).


## How To Use?

My usual workflow involves using [GlyphSearch](http://glyphsearch.com/?library=font-awesome). Here you can view a catalog of all of Font Awesome's icons. The filenames in this repo are the same as what you'll see here.

From there you can include the icon with an <img> tag, paste the code directly into your HTML, or use that code to create an SVG sprite.
